The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.	service general	negative
He offers subpar service and has no personality.	service general	negative

There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.	service general	negative
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.	service general	negative

I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.	service general	positive
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	service general	positive
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	ambience general	positive
