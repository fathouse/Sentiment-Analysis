The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.	restaurant prices	negative
To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.	drinks prices	negative
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	drinks prices	negative

I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.	food style options	positive
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.	food prices	negative

The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.	food prices	negative

On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.	food quality	negative
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.	food quality	negative
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.	service general	positive
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).	drinks prices	negative

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	restaurant general	positive
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	location general	positive
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!	location general	positive

To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	service general	positive
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	food quality	positive

For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	food quality	positive

The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	food quality	positive

My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.	food quality	positive
I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.	food quality	positive
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue: Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	restaurant miscellaneous	neutral

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.	restaurant miscellaneous	negative
All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.	restaurant general	positive
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.	food quality	positive
